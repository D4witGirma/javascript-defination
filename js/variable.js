A variable is a quantity that may be changed according to the mathematical problem.
 The generic letters which are used in many algebraic expressions and equations are x, y, z. In other words, 
a variable is a symbol for a number where the value is not known. For example, x + 5 = 10. Here “x” is a variable.*/
